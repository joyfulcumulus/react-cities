# Le Wagon Cities (React JS)

## Description
* Motivation: Previously I had created React components in isolation (without reference to any external APIs). I wanted to move towards a more realistic scenario where I had to utilise an API to fetch some information that was part of the React component
* Learnings: How to store the user's selected city in a State hook, which is then used to call the Le Wagon API as a parameter

Note: For clarity: I did not use Redux even though the tutorial was for Redux, as the state management is not complex for now.
